Coding standards used for programming js, designing html and css, picking file names.

1. Naming.

1.1. All names of css classes and html identifiers shall be in lower case with
hyphen between words.
For example: left-corner, button, property-grid-holder.

1.2. CSS classes and IDs that used in the javascript code shall be preceded with "jb-" prefix
in order to introduce visible difference between ordinary classes/IDs.
For example: jb-item, jb-label-1, jb-datetime-picker-site.

1.3. File names shall be in all lowercase with hyphen between words.
For example: virtual-grid.js, kinetic-scrollbar.css, index.html.


2. Javascript coding.

2.1. Global variables shall be avoided at all costs. On the other side if all the
other solutions would introduce inefficient or more complicated code their usage is
acceptable.
