JavaScript Virtual List - List with support of arbitrary (very large) number of items

## Motivation

Very lightweight implementation of the virtual list without extra dependencies targeted WebKit-based browsers (Chrome, Safari, Web View on iOS, Android, QtWebKit and some versions of Firefox and Opera).

No extra dependencies required.
